Base

Create a quotes array on the server.

The get request /quotes should
send the array to the client side, where you should
use jQuery to display the quotes on the DOM.

Each quote should be an object with two properties:

    1. the text for the quote
    2. the author (person the quote is attributed to)

You will need to
setup Node with express to
serve static files from a public folder, and an index.html and client.js file in your public folder in order for this to work.


Stretch Goals

    Add the ability to add new quotes using POST
    Use Bootstrap to style the page. Use a card with a block-quote to nicely lay out each of the quotes.
    Add a new server route '/random' that should send back a single random quote.
    Add an image for each quote. You'll need to put the images in your public folder and add a property to the quote objects to hold the image path.
